# iCodeThis-DailyChallanges
1 Hour streaming attempts at the daily challenges from a site I found called iCodeThis. It gives you a finished design product and you build it. No design sheet or specs. 

## Essentially
These challenges are building components. Each of these could be deployed on a real site. 

## What is captivating about it
The reason I find this more entertaining then leetcode and codewars and cssbattles it is more real world. You see something online and want to create it without copying script kiddie'ing it. With the lack of design sheets, it's up to you to figure it out. 
The project is something I seen a fellow developer just promoting on twitter and figured I try it one night. Now I stream while I do it. It also has tailwind built in, which I use. 

Its also nice to use basic vanilla web development instead of frameworks. It's literally like playing a game.
